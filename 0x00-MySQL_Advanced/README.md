## Triggers
Back to DDL, triggers helps to automatically change some data in a a table based on changes in another table, they are user specified actions that fire when a specific change (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) happens to the data.


> Updating multiple tables for one action from your application can generate issue: network disconnection, crash, etcâ€¦ to keep your data in a good shape, let MySQL do it for you!

```sql
-- automatically decrease the quantity (UPDATE) of an item after (AFTER) adding (INSERT) a new order

CREATE TRIGGER
    IF NOT EXISTS
       decrease_quantity_after_new_order
 AFTER INSERT
    ON orders
   FOR EACH ROW

   UPDATE items
      SET quantity = quantity - NEW.number
    WHERE name = NEW.item_name;
```

Now this is part of the orders table
